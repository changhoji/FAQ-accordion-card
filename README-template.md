## My process

### Built with

- html
- css
- javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use basic javascript and how to use javascript in HTML.

```js
var target = document.qeurySelector("~~~");
var sibling = target.nextElementSibling;
```

In javascript, I tried to style the next element of an specific element. But I found and used the next Sibling, but I couldn't choose what I wanted. So, looking further, I learned that nextElementSibling should be used to select the next sibling tag because nextSibling also selects plain text elements.
