## My process

### Built with

- html
- css
- javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use basic javascript and how to use javascript in HTML.

```js
var target = document.qeurySelector("~~~");
var sibling = target.nextElementSibling;
```

In javascript, I tried to style the next element of an specific element. But I found and used the next Sibling, but I couldn't choose what I wanted. So, looking further, I learned that nextElementSibling should be used to select the next sibling tag because nextSibling also selects plain text elements.


### Useful resources

- [childNodes, parentNode, Sibling](https://itun.tistory.com/501) - This helped me for How to approach nearby elements from specific element.
- 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
